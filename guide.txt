Implementation Overview of Nginx with Virtual Hosting and DNS Configuration

This document outlines the steps implemented to set up a web server using Nginx with support for virtual hosting, DNS configuration, and SSL for secure communication. The goal was to configure the domain suraj.com and its subdomains, ensuring scalability and secure hosting. Below is a detailed description of the implementation without specific code snippets:

1. Installing Nginx
Installed the Nginx web server based on the server's operating system (CentOS/RedHat or Debian/Ubuntu).
Ensured the installation of required dependencies for smooth operation.

2. Starting and Enabling Nginx
Configured the Nginx service to start immediately and ensured it would automatically start on system boot.
Verified the service was running and accessible on the default HTTP port (80).

3. Setting Up the Default Web Page
Created a basic default web page in the appropriate document root directory for the server's operating system.
The page displayed a simple message to confirm the successful setup of the Nginx server.

4. Configuring DNS
DNS Zone Setup
Configured DNS zones for the domain suraj.com to resolve its subdomains (e.g., www.suraj.com) to the server's IP address.
Created a dedicated zone file for suraj.com with appropriate DNS records (A and NS).

DNS Service Configuration
Ensured the DNS service (named or bind9) was installed, running, and configured to start on boot.
Verified the DNS resolution to confirm domain-to-IP mapping.

5. Configuring Virtual Hosting
Web Directory Creation
Created distinct directories for the main server and virtual hosts to organize content for different domains.
Added unique HTML files to differentiate between the content served by the main server and the virtual host.

Virtual Host Configuration
Defined separate server blocks in Nginx configuration files for the main domain (suraj.com) and its virtual host (vhost.suraj.com).
Configured server names, document roots, and log files for each domain.
Enabled the virtual host configurations by linking them to the active directory and restarting Nginx.

6. Enabling SSL
Generated SSL certificates and private keys for secure communication.
Configured Nginx to serve content over HTTPS using the generated certificates.
Ensured SSL was applied to all virtual hosts for secure access.

7. Testing the Setup
Verified the DNS configuration by testing domain resolution.
Tested HTTP access to ensure the default and virtual host pages were correctly served.
Tested HTTPS access to verify SSL functionality, bypassing browser warnings for self-signed certificates during the initial setup.

Additional Considerations
Security: Allowed traffic on HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) through the firewall. Recommended using trusted SSL certificates for production.
Automation: Suggested using Certbot with Let's Encrypt for automated SSL certificate management.
Logging: Ensured log files were correctly configured and accessible to Nginx for monitoring.

Conclusion
This implementation resulted in a robust and secure web server using Nginx, supporting virtual hosting, custom DNS configuration, and SSL for secure communication. The setup is scalable for hosting multiple domains and provides a foundation for deploying production-grade web applications.
